## Installing Zensical on Ubuntu — Sandbox Setup

![Zensical-hero1](/assets/images/zensical-hero-default-install.png)

This documents the sandbox installation of Zensical on `ubuntu-web-vm` as a potential replacement for the existing Jekyll/Chirpy production site at `/var/www/websites/calabiyau19.github.io` (pontifex.site).

Zensical is a modern static site generator built by the creators of Material for MkDocs. It is written in Rust and Python, MIT licensed, and actively developed. It uses `zensical.toml` as its native config format and `docs/` as its content directory — both familiar concepts if you've used MkDocs or Jekyll.

Official documentation: `zensical.org`

---

## Why Zensical

Jekyll is a mature but aging platform. MkDocs 1.x has been unmaintained since August 2024. Zensical is the forward-looking platform from the Material for MkDocs team — modern design, built-in dark mode, excellent code block handling, and actively developed.

---

## Environment

- **Server:** `ubuntu-web-vm` (`192.168.1.72`)
- **Management laptop:** `lpt-HP` (`192.168.1.100`)
- **Python version:** 3.12.3 (pre-installed on Ubuntu 24.04)
- **Shell on ubuntu-web-vm:** Fish (via `f` alias from Bash login shell)
- **Sandbox location:** `~/websites/zensical`
- **Isolation method:** Python virtual environment (`.venv`)
- **Production site:** unaffected — remains at `/var/www/websites/calabiyau19.github.io`

---

## Prerequisites

Verify Python is available:

```sh
python3 --version
```

Must return `Python 3.12.3` or similar. If not present, install Python before proceeding.

Install the venv bootstrap package — required on Ubuntu 24.04 before a virtual environment can be created:

```sh
sudo apt install python3.12-venv
```

Without this, `python3 -m venv` fails with an `ensurepip is not available` error.

---

## Create the Sandbox Directory

```sh
mkdir -p ~/websites/zensical
```

```sh
cd ~/websites/zensical
```

All subsequent steps happen inside this directory. The production Jekyll site at `/var/www/websites/` is completely separate and unaffected.

---

## Create the Virtual Environment

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
```

This creates a `.venv/` subfolder containing a private, isolated Python and pip. Anything installed while this venv is active stays contained here — system Python is never touched. Deleting `~/websites/zensical` later removes every trace cleanly.

---

## Activate the Virtual Environment

Since `ubuntu-web-vm` uses Fish shell, the activation command differs from the standard Bash version shown in most documentation:

```sh
source .venv/bin/activate.fish
```

The Fish prompt may not visually indicate activation due to the custom Tide prompt. Verify it worked:

```sh
which python3
```

Must return `/home/mark/websites/zensical/.venv/bin/python3`. If it returns a system path, stop and re-run the activation command before proceeding.

**Every new session requires these two commands before any Zensical work:**

```sh
cd ~/websites/zensical
```

```sh
source .venv/bin/activate.fish
```

---

## Install Zensical

Per the official Zensical documentation at `zensical.org/docs/get-started/`:

```sh
pip install zensical
```

This installs Zensical and all required dependencies automatically. Confirmed installed version: `zensical-0.0.46`.

Verify the install:

```sh
zensical --version
```

Returns: `0.0.46`

---

## Initialize the Project

```sh
zensical new .
```

The `.` initializes the project in the current directory. Creates the following structure:

```
~/websites/zensical/
├─ .github/workflows/
│  └─ docs.yml          # GitHub Actions workflow for deployment (used later)
├─ .venv/               # Python virtual environment
├─ docs/
│  ├─ index.md          # Starter home page
│  └─ markdown.md       # Feature demonstration page
└─ zensical.toml        # Project configuration file
```

Verify:

```sh
ls -la ~/websites/zensical
```

---

## Open Port 8000 in UFW

Zensical's built-in dev server defaults to port 8000. Add a UFW rule allowing access from the management laptop only:

```sh
sudo ufw allow from 192.168.1.100 to any port 8000
```

Verify it is active:

```sh
sudo ufw status
```

Port 8000 should appear as `ALLOW` from `192.168.1.100`.

---

## Start the Dev Server — Initial Test

Zensical defaults to binding on `localhost` only. To make it reachable from the management laptop, bind to all interfaces explicitly:

```sh
zensical serve --dev-addr=0.0.0.0:8000
```

Browse to `http://192.168.1.72:8000` from the management laptop. The default starter content should be visible with the three-column Material layout.

---

## What You Get Out of the Box

Confirmed working with zero configuration:

- Clean three-column layout — left navigation, main content, right table of contents
- Built-in dark/light mode toggle (top right header)
- Search with `Ctrl+K` keyboard shortcut
- Syntax-highlighted code blocks with copy button
- Admonitions (Note, Warning, colored callout boxes)
- Content tabs, diagrams, footnotes, tooltips — all built in

---

## Configure zensical.toml

With the server confirmed working, stop it with `Ctrl+C` and configure the project settings before continuing.

The default `zensical.toml` needs four values updated. Use these `sed` commands to make the changes without opening the file:

Set the site name:

```sh
sed -i 's/site_name = "Documentation"/site_name = "Pontifex"/' ~/websites/zensical/zensical.toml
```

Set the site description:

```sh
sed -i 's/site_description = "A new project generated from the default template project."/site_description = "Linux self-hosting documentation"/' ~/websites/zensical/zensical.toml
```

Set the site author:

```sh
sed -i 's/site_author = "<your name here>"/site_author = "calabiyau19"/' ~/websites/zensical/zensical.toml
```

Uncomment and set the site URL to the server's local IP for development:

```sh
sed -i 's|#site_url = "https://www.example.com/"|site_url = "http://192.168.1.72:8000"|' ~/websites/zensical/zensical.toml
```

Verify all four values before proceeding:

```sh
grep -E 'site_name|site_description|site_author|site_url' ~/websites/zensical/zensical.toml
```

Expected output:

```sh
site_name = "Pontifex"
site_description = "Linux self-hosting documentation"
site_author = "calabiyau19"
site_url = "http://192.168.1.72:8000"
```

---

## Make the Bind Address Persistent

Rather than passing `--dev-addr=0.0.0.0:8000` every time, set it permanently in `zensical.toml`.

First confirm what line `site_url` is on:

```sh
grep -n "site_url" ~/websites/zensical/zensical.toml
```

Then insert `dev_addr` on the line immediately after it (substituting the actual line number if different from 30):

```sh
sed -i '30a dev_addr = "0.0.0.0:8000"' ~/websites/zensical/zensical.toml
```

Verify placement:

```sh
sed -n '28,33p' ~/websites/zensical/zensical.toml
```

Expected output — `dev_addr` must appear directly after `site_url`:

```sh
# documentation you should set this.
# Read more: https://zensical.org/docs/setup/basics/#site_url
site_url = "http://192.168.1.72:8000"
dev_addr = "0.0.0.0:8000"
# The copyright notice appears in the page footer and can contain an HTML
```

---

## Start the Dev Server — Final

With `dev_addr` t in config, no flag is needed:

```sh
zensical serve
```

Browse to `http://192.168.1.72:8000` from the management laptop. The header should now show **Pontifex** instead of **Documentation**.

---

## Starting a New Session

The venv must be activated at the start of every session. The server does not persist across terminal sessions.

```sh
cd ~/websites/zensical
```

```sh
source .venv/bin/activate.fish
```

```sh
zensical serve
```

---

## Current State

- Zensical `0.0.46` installed and running at `http://192.168.1.72:8000`
- `zensical.toml` configured: site name, description, author, local URL, persistent bind address
- Starter content in place: `docs/index.md` and `docs/markdown.md`
- Ready for content migration from Jekyll `_posts/`

---

## Next Steps

- Explore theme configuration (colors, fonts, logo)
- Begin content migration from Jekyll/Chirpy (`_posts/` → `docs/`)
- Plan navigation structure by topic category
- Decide on GitHub Pages deployment approach
- Set up a systemd service or tmux session so `zensical serve` persists across terminal sessions
