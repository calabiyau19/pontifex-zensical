## Setting Up System-Wide File Search on lpt-HP with Recoll



I wanted a real full-text search tool on lpt-HP (my Linux Mint management laptop) — something that could search file *contents*, not just filenames, across my home directory, an external backup drive, and a couple of shares from other machines on the network. I ended up with [Recoll](https://www.recoll.org/), a mature Xapian-based search tool. Getting the scope right took a few wrong turns, so I'm documenting what actually happened, not just the clean version.

### Why Recoll, not a filename-search tool

I initially looked at a tool called EverythingX, but it turned out to only index *filenames*, not file contents — no good for searching inside my Obsidian vault notes. Recoll does real full-text indexing and has been maintained for roughly 20 years, built on the Xapian search library.

### Installing Recoll

Recoll's GUI package is available directly from Ubuntu's universe repo (Linux Mint tracks Ubuntu's base, so this works without adding any PPA):

```sh
sudo apt install recoll
```

This pulls in `recoll` (the GUI), `recollcmd`, `recollgui`, and the Qt dependencies.

### Deciding what to actually index

The goal was "search everything on lpt-HP," but that needed real scoping decisions:

- **User-only, not root** — Recoll runs as your own user account, so anything owned by root or other users is silently skipped. That's an accepted limitation, not a bug.
- **Local drives already mounted under `/mnt`** — a Samba share (`network-storage`, containing movies/music) and several drives from my Windows machine (`win_e`, `win_f`, `win_g`, `win_c`) were already visible locally, so no extra SSHFS/NFS setup was needed for those.
- **Remote servers (NUC5/NUC3 VMs)** — Recoll has no native network protocol. It can only index local filesystem paths. To search a remote server, its filesystem would need to be mounted locally first (SSHFS/NFS/Samba), then added to the config like any local folder. I decided to treat this as a future phase rather than bite it off immediately.

### The config file

Recoll's per-index settings live in `~/.recoll/recoll.conf`, auto-created on first launch.

```sh
recoll
```

Cancel the first-run auto-index prompt if it appears, so the config can be set up before the first real indexing pass.

```sh
nano ~/.recoll/recoll.conf
```

**Final `topdirs`** — the paths to actually walk:

```
topdirs = / /media/mark/Ext_T7_lpthp /mnt/win_c/Users/marks/Documents /mnt/win_c/Users/marks/Downloads
```

Setting `topdirs` to `/` covers the whole local filesystem, including everything already mounted under `/mnt` (`network-storage`, `win_e`, `win_f`, `win_g`). `win_c` is a full Windows C: drive — Program Files, Windows folder, etc. — so only two specific subfolders (Documents, Downloads) were added explicitly rather than the whole share.

**Final `skippedPaths`** — directories to never walk into:

```
skippedPaths = /proc /sys /dev /run /tmp /var/tmp /usr /var /bin /sbin /lib /lib64 /boot /snap /opt ~/.cache ~/.local/share/Trash /mnt/win_c /mnt/win_f /mnt/win_g /media/mark/Ext_T7_lpthp/timeshift /media/mark/Ext_T7_lpthp/system-backups /media/mark/Ext_T7_lpthp/dejadup-backups /media/mark/Ext_T7_lpthp/home-backup-20260611 "/media/mark/Ext_T7_lpthp/Ghost Backup" /media/mark/Ext_T7_lpthp/email-backups /media/mark/Ext_T7_lpthp/Browser-Backups /media/mark/Ext_T7_lpthp/Shell-History-Backup
```

**Final `skippedNames`** — filename/pattern matches skipped anywhere in the tree:

```
skippedNames = .git node_modules __pycache__ .venv venv $RECYCLE.BIN .Trash .Trash-1000 lost+found *.qcow2 *.vmdk *.iso *.img .cargo
```

A few notes on why these exclusions exist:

- **`/usr /var /bin /sbin /lib* /boot /opt /snap`** — pure OS and program internals per the Linux Filesystem Hierarchy Standard, never personal files. Confirmed by running `sudo du -x --max-depth=3 -h / | sort -rh | head -50` to see what was actually consuming space before excluding it.
- **`~/.cache`** — browser/app caches, no search value, can be several GB of pure noise.
- **`/mnt/win_c`** (except the two named subfolders) — a full Windows system drive. Note: simply *not listing* the whole share in `topdirs` does **not** exclude it if `/` is also in `topdirs` — `skippedPaths` is the only mechanism that actually blocks the walk. I got this wrong on the first attempt and let the whole C: drive get indexed for 12+ hours before catching it.
- **`/mnt/win_f`** — this drive contains a ~50,000-photo dump that was uploaded to Immich and is now kept only as cold-storage backup; redundant with Immich's own indexing.
- **`/mnt/win_g`** — cold-storage backups including Windows `$RECYCLE.BIN` and `.Trash` folders.
- **Ext_T7 backup folders** (`timeshift`, `system-backups`, `dejadup-backups`, dated home backup, Ghost/email/browser/shell-history backups) — full snapshot/backup archives, not searchable content. `Website-Backups` was deliberately kept searchable.
- **`.git`, `node_modules`, `__pycache__`, `.venv`/`venv`, `.cargo`** — package manager caches and VCS internals, third-party downloaded content rather than authored files.
- **`$RECYCLE.BIN`, `.Trash`, `.Trash-1000`, `lost+found`** — deleted-file history and filesystem recovery junk.
- **`*.qcow2`, `*.vmdk`, `*.iso`, `*.img`** — VM disk images and ISOs, large binary blobs with no text content to index.

### Running the index

```sh
recollindex
```

The first (badly-scoped) attempt ran for over 12 hours and hit 91GB before being stopped — almost entirely due to the `win_c` full-drive mistake above. After correcting the config and wiping the partial index:

```sh
rm -rf ~/.recoll/xapiandb
```

```sh
recollindex
```

The corrected run completed in about 50 minutes, producing a 6.0GB index — a reasonable size for the actual intended scope.

### Fixing the tiny UI text

Recoll's Qt-based interface opened unreadably small. Recoll does have a **Display scale** setting under Preferences → User interface, but the dialog itself was too small to comfortably use at first. The simplest fix: temporarily drop the monitor's display scaling from 125% to 100%, which made the Recoll preferences dialog usable long enough to set **Display scale to 2.70** — after that, the setting persists on its own and the monitor scaling can go back to normal.

### Setting up a keybinding

Cinnamon → Keyboard → Shortcuts → find an unused binding (I reused `Super+S`, previously mapped to "Show Desklets," a feature I never use) → assign it to the command `recoll`.

### Verifying it actually works

```sh
recoll
```

A search for a known term (a song title from an Obsidian note) returned the correct result — confirming the index is genuinely searching file contents, not just filenames.
